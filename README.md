### Description of the project:
This project consists on the creation of a function that reads a file, line per line. To try this project, you can use the commented main function in the `get_next_line.c` (mandatory) or the `get_next_line_bonus.c` (bonus) file.
The difference between the mandatory and the bonus part is that the mandatory can only read from a single file, while the bonus can read from multiple files.
